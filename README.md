# RocketGL
Basic rocket physics library, operates on the basis of polymorphism across different rocket component sub-classes, with the evaluation of rocket variables varying depending on what the focus component is (since different components factor in different variables).
## Rendering
Uses a custom figure rendering library to render 3d figures with GLUT, rocket component rendering is done in class libraries
## To-do
Many of the functions of the rocket classes are not yet implemented, those will be added with time, this is just a first version
Note: main.cpp is just an implementation, not a part of the library
